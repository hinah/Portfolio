Hi there! I’m Hina, UX & UI designer from Manchester.

I’m a multidisciplinary designer focused on building connected products, services, and interactive experiences. I’ve had the pleasure of working with many talented people alongside some incredible companies – including EE, Pretty little thing, BooHoo.com, JD Sport, and a few others. More importantly, I’m passionate about creating meaningful work of enduring value – work that makes an unforgettable contribution to people’s lives, big or small.
